Legendary artist, Leonardo da Vinci is a famous Milanese and his footprints are all over this striking metropolis in the form of his paintings, sculptures and buildings. When you come to Milan, you too will feel like a Renaissance man/woman as the city awakens your creative spirit while keeping intact the traditional values. Here are 30 things you can do while you’re in Milan:</p><h2 id="admire-the-last-supper-at-santa-maria-delle-grazie"><br>Admire the Last Supper at Santa Maria Delle Grazie</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.travellens.co/content/images/2019/09/Santa-Maria-Delle-Grazie.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Santa Maria Delle Grazie"><figcaption>muratart / Shutterstock.com</figcaption></figure><p>The Church of Santa Maria Delle Grazie is a world heritage site best known for housing the famous painting called ‘the last supper’ by legendary artist Leonardo da Vinci. The painting is done on the wall of the church’s dining room and depicts in all its glory the final dinner of Jesus Christ with his disciples. In order to visit the room, you need to book the tickets in advance through the convent’s official website. The church itself is a stunning reminder of 15th century Renaissance Catholic art as well as Italy’s rich cultural history.</p><h2 id="travel-back-to-the-13th-century-at-the-milan-cathedral">Travel Back to the 13th Century at the Milan Cathedral</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.travellens.co/content/images/2019/09/Milan-Cathedral.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Milan Cathedral"><figcaption>Noppasin Wongchum / Shutterstock.com</figcaption></figure><p>The Milan Duomo is a cathedral situated in the city which is 600 years old and is the fifth largest Christian Church in the world. The construction of this solid yet serene structure began in 1386 and went on until the early 19th century which gives it the most detailed architecture of any cathedral in the world. Here, there are 3,400 statues, 700 figures and 135 gargoyles that can be admired by tourists as well as a sundial on the floor which was placed by Astronomers in the year 1768.</p><h2 id="live-like-a-royal-at-the-sforzesco-castle">Live Like a Royal at the Sforzesco Castle</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.travellens.co/content/images/2019/09/Sforzesco-Castle.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Sforzesco Castle"><figcaption>Olena Z / Shutterstock.com</figcaption></figure><p>The Sforzesco castle is an oasis of Milan’s culture and history as well as the former home of the mighty rulers of this city, the Sforza’s. It had previously been used as a military complex and only in the 19th century was it transformed as the headquarters of the Milan’s Civic Museums. The castle is breathtaking in itself but is made even more valuable due to the prized ancient and modern art displayed in the museum such as Michelangelo’s Pieta Rondanini and a few libraries.</p><h2 id="cruise-around-the-navigli-lombardi">Cruise Around the Navigli Lombardi</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.travellens.co/content/images/2019/09/Navigli-Lombardi.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Navigli Lombardi"><figcaption>Ioan Florin Cnejevici / Shutterstock.com</figcaption></figure><p>The Navigli Lombardi is the largest canal of Milan and was the busiest thoroughfares in the 13th century and was perfected by Leonardo da Vinci in the 16th century. Here, you not only get to relax while gliding on the waterway but at the same time, witness some of the most historic and striking architecture on both sides of the canal. You can either book yourself a modern cruise or live your romantic dreams by sitting in a Venetian Gondola.</p><h2 id="be-a-guest-at-leonardo-da-vinci-s-vineyard">Be a Guest at Leonardo Da Vinci’s Vineyard</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.travellens.co/content/images/2019/09/La-Vigna-di-Leonardo.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Leonardo Da Vinci’s Vineyard"><figcaption>Alexey Broslavets / Shutterstock.com</figcaption></figure><p>The Renaissance man, Leonardo da Vinci left behind a gorgeous vineyard tucked away in his quaint private residence called La Vigna di Leonardo. It was heavily bombed and dismantled during the Second World War and was revived in 2015 during the Expo Milan. A visitor can also book a room at the Atellani apartments situated inside the vineyard which has six boutique rooms accompanied by a lush green private Garden. The building fulfils the painter’s famous saying ‘simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.</p><h2 id="visit-an-urban-jungle-at-isola">Visit an Urban Jungle at Isola</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.travellens.co/content/images/2019/09/Isola-milan.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Isola Milan"><figcaption>faber1893 / Shutterstock.com</figcaption></figure><p>Isola in Italian translates to an ‘island’ and while, this place is not an island in the traditional sense but is cut off from the other part of the city by rail roads. This neighborhood is arguably the urban soul of Milan and this is clearly evidenced by its many architectural marvels such as the Porta Nuova skyscrapers and the Bosco Verticale residential apartment building with an urban jungle at every corner. It is wrought with street art, fusion restaurants and hipster bars.</p><h2 id="watch-a-live-performance-at-the-teatro-alla-scala">Watch a Live Performance at the Teatro Alla Scala</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.travellens.co/content/images/2019/09/Teatro-Alla-Scala.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Teatro Alla Scala"><figcaption>Catarina Belova / Shutterstock.com</figcaption></figure><p>The Teatro Alla Scala is one of the most revered opera houses in the world and is arguably, the premier institution of performing arts in Milan.

There is also a museum where you can see the costumes, drafts and memorabilia of La Scala theatre as well as a cheaper prized theatre called Loggione.</p><h2 id="read-a-book-at-biblioteca-nazionale-braidense">Read a Book at Biblioteca Nazionale Braidense</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.travellens.co/content/images/2019/09/Biblioteca-Nazionale-Braidense.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Biblioteca Nazionale Braidense"><figcaption>Paolo Bona / Shutterstock.com</figcaption></figure><p>The Braidense national library is a public library built in 1770 and was made open to the civilians in the year 1880.

The architecture was heavily renovated and modified from the 12th and 13th centuries to the 19th century. The upper part of the basilica has vertical mullioned windows with striking decorative arches and the side chapels are from different eras such as Renaissance and Neoclassical. The painting of the Coronation of Mary is also housed here.</p><h2 id="have-a-spa-day-at-albergo-diurno-venezia">Have a Spa Day at Albergo Diurno Venezia</h2><p>Under the surface of Piazza Oberdan lies a lesser known tourist spot called the Albergo Diurno Venezia which was built in 1925 and is used as an unconventional spa with 30 bathrooms ranging from average to luxury as well as shaves, manicures and pedicures. Though, there is more to the place including a post office, a barber shop, flower shops, phone booths, newsstands and a bank.<br>This is a quirky and unique spot for every tourist to visit in order to get under the skin of Milan.</p><h2 id="the-home-of-the-dead-cimitero-monumentale">The Home of the Dead, Cimitero Monumentale</h2><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://www.travellens.co/content/images/2019/09/Cimitero-Monumentale.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Cimitero Monumentale"><figcaption>Tara Van Der Linden Photo / Shutterstock.com</figcaption></figure><p>The Cimitero Monumentale is one of the oldest graveyards in the city and has the most architecturally marvelous tombs in the entire country.
